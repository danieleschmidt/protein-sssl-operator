# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The protein-sssl-operator implements a sophisticated three-stage pipeline for protein structure prediction:

```
[Self-Supervised Pre-training] → [Neural Operator Fine-tuning] → [Structure Prediction]
```

### Core Components

#### 1. Self-Supervised Learning Encoder (`protein_sssl.models.ssl_encoder`)

**SequenceStructureSSL**: Transformer-based encoder with multiple SSL objectives:
- **Masked Language Modeling**: Predicts masked amino acids from context
- **Contrastive Learning**: Learns sequence representations via InfoNCE loss
- **Distance Prediction**: Learns spatial relationships from sequence

**Key Features**:
- Rotary positional embeddings for better sequence modeling
- Multi-head attention with configurable architecture
- Gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency

#### 2. Neural Operator Backbone (`protein_sssl.models.neural_operator`)

**NeuralOperatorFold**: Combines Fourier Neural Operators with structure-aware attention:

**Fourier Layers**: Model protein folding as continuous transformations
```python
# Fourier operator maps sequence space to structure space
x_ft = FFT(x)  # Transform to frequency domain
out_ft = weights * x_ft  # Apply learned operators
out = IFFT(out_ft)  # Transform back to spatial domain
```

**Structure Attention**: Incorporates geometric biases
- Distance-aware attention masks
- Multi-scale feature aggregation
- Physics-informed constraints

#### 3. Structure Decoder (`protein_sssl.models.structure_decoder`)

**StructurePredictor**: Converts neural operator outputs to 3D coordinates:
- Distance geometry for coordinate generation
- Uncertainty quantification via ensemble methods
- Iterative refinement through recycling
